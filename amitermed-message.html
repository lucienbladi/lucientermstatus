    <h1>Very Important Notice</h1>
    <p>To my friends or people who have direct contact with me, or who have been invited to this page: 
        Please be mindful of the impact of your words. Avoid making unnecessary jokes that could escalate a situation beyond your intention. Your support and understanding are greatly appreciated.
    Please also note, I am going to be fine and I am currently fighting this out mentally and in every way possible to try to mentally recover from the defamation, harassment, and intentional infliction of emotional trauma brought upon me. I hope to be able to get the chance to update you all soon, so far nothing important has occured.</p>
